# Workbot chat client

This client is designed to suit a server like https://github.com/Citizen-AI/workbot-webchat-server.

I find [autoreload-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-autoreload-server) a convenient way of hosting the client locally.

Use the `server` parameter to override the hardcoded (in `client.js`) server url. E.g.:

> `http://localhost:8080/index.html?server=localhost:3000`
